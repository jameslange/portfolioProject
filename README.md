In my childhood I played a lot of video games. I enjoyed the challenge of formulating and adapting different strategies in order to be successful playing them. Today I feel a similar enjoyment when writing code.The same satisfaction I used to receive upon success in a video game I now feel when writing successful code.

Balance is very important to me. In order to keep a clear mind I meditate one hour each day and maintain a healthy body by managing my nutrition and exercise by lifting weights and doing yoga. I also aim to walk each day in order to stay healthy. These habits provide me with the energy required to focus every day.

Traveling to experience other cultures and to see new things has always been a motivation for me. I enjoy hiking and the nature of each country that I travel to. In my previous career I worked as a tour guide doing seasonal trips across the United States. During the season I drove groups of tourists and guided them through National Parks and cities throughout the U.S. During the off-season I spent my time traveling in Mexico, India, and Southeast Asia. This has given me a diverse perspective of the world and I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to have these experiences.
