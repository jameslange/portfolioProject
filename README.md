# Backend Portfolio Project

I completed this project and deployed it to heroku as part of my course at the Digital Career Institute. I am using [this](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page237/neuron) free HTML/CSS template. All of the photos on the Gallery on Contact page I have taken myself and have included in this project in order to show myself a bit better.

This project is hosted at [jameslange.me](jameslange.me)

Have a nice day!

## Technologies Used

For this project I mostly focused on the backend, utilizing NodeJS, Express, EJS, Google Captcha, and Nodemailer.

The template came with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
